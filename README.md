## Overview
## 🔬 Technical Abstract: The Chemistry of Semantic Stability

**Thesis:** *Project Agora: A Topological Framework for Formalizing AGI Invariants via Lean 4*

Current AGI alignment methodologies rely heavily on statistical reinforcement (RLHF), which remains vulnerable to **Semantic Drift** and **Deceptive Alignment** due to the lack of an underlying structural invariant. This research introduces **Project Agora**, a neuro-symbolic architecture that treats the "Space of Reasons" as a geometric manifold ($S_o$). 

Drawing on principles of **Phase Equilibrium** and **Molecular Stability** from industrial chemistry, we define core semantic anchors as basis vectors in a formal Domain-Specific Language (**CF-DSL**). Using the **Lean 4 theorem prover**, we implement a **Coherence Restorative Projection (CRP)**—a mathematical operator that identifies "Subspace Leakage" ($S_d$) and restores the agent’s internal state to a verified coherent manifold. By establishing the **Epsilon-Bound ($\epsilon$)** as a stability threshold, this framework provides a mathematically verifiable "Steel Cage" for AGI reasoning, ensuring that critical concepts remain path-connected to their logical obligations ($S_o$) regardless of neural entropy.
